# Home Assistant AddOns

## Local Dashboard on Home Assistant OS 

Addon to display a Dashboard on a device running Home Assistant OS, which is usually impossible because of the (almost) immutability of HAOS. 
[All credit goes to puterboy from the Home Assistant community](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/ha-kiosk-on-rpi5-running-haos/849371/6). I just put it into a repository for easier installation.

Instead of displaying a webpage, you can also display media by pointing to a file in your media library `file:///media/
